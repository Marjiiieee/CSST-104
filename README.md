# ***Subject Introduction***


* [Advance Machine Learning](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/si/310785/) makes more use of data to improve the performance of the system. This data-based advanced machine learning is an important approach in modern intelligent technology. It looks for laws from observed data (samples) and uses regular patterns to predict future unobservable data. As artificial intelligence grows, the application field of machine learning develops further. This pushes higher demands for model training and applications, the improvement of the algorithm, and increased arithmetic power.


* [Linear Regression](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/geoai/how-linear-regression-works.htm#:~:text=Linear%20regression%20is%20a%20supervised,the%20data%20using%20least%20squares.)  is a supervised machine learning method that is used by the Train Using AutoML tool and finds a linear equation that best describes the correlation of the explanatory variables with the dependent variable. 

* Data modeling is the process of creating a visual representation of the structure and organization of data within a system or organization. It involves defining the data entities, their attributes, relationships, and constraints in order to facilitate understanding, communication, and development of databases and information systems.
